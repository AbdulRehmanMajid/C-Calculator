The C++ Calculator Program is a console-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By utilizing OOP concepts, the program is organized into distinct classes and objects, making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. The calculator accepts user input, performs the requested operation, and outputs the result. This project serves as an excellent example of how to apply OOP to solve real-world problems like building a simple calculator.

## Features
- #### Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- #### Object-Oriented Design: The program is structured using OOP concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and methods, ensuring code reusability and modularity.
- #### User Input: The user is prompted to input two numbers and choose an operation.
- #### Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling, such as catching division by zero errors.
- #### Extensibility: The design allows easy addition of more complex operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation) in the future.
## Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the C++ Calculator Program, you need to have the following software installed:

- #### C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- #### Text Editor/IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any C++ IDE)

## Installation
- #### Clone this repository to your local machine:
'''
git clone https://github.com/AbdulRehmanMajid/C-Calculator.git
'''
- #### Navigate to the project directory:
'''
cd C-Calculator
'''
- #### Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler:
'''
g++ -o Calc main.cpp
'''
- #### Run the program:
'''
./Calc
'''
## Usage
- #### Start the Program: Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation.
- #### Choose Operation: The user selects an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- #### Display Result: After performing the calculation, the program outputs the result of the operation.
- #### Repeat or Exit: The user can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.
